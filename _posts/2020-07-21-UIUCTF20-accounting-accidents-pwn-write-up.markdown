UIUCTF20 was a really fun Animal Crossing themed CTF that ran from July 17-19 2020. While I have not played the game before, I knew somewhat what it was about from watching Youtubers play it. I know a few female friends who are really into the game, and it is also worth noting that this is one of the games where there seems to be more female players.

Our team PPP came in third place, which went above my expectations as most people playing were relatively new and I am quite happy with the result. Now, on to the writeup!

### About The Banner Picture
This picture was taken during my hike up Mt. Tallac at Lake Tahoe last summer (2019). You can see a glimpse of the lake in the background. The hike was around 10 miles, with an elevation gain of around 3.3k ft.
