It was three years ago that I was introduced the concept of the "power law" in Peter Thiel's book, [Zero to One: Notes on Startups, Or How To Build The Future](http://zerotoonebook.com/). Thiel stated that "We don't live in a normal world, we live under a power law. Exponential equations describe severely unequal distributions". This, in effect, is very similar to the 80/20 rule that I discussed in my previous post, and observations of such a distribution can be found ranging from income
distributions to the fact that the best venture capital fund investments grow to a value that eclipses the rest of their portfolios combined. The power law is extremely unintuitive for humans as we are accustomed to seeing things in a linear fashion. However, we ignore the power law at our own peril. A single outlier performs much better than a large average sample combined, and it is precisely the power law that we must understand in order to unlock this phenomenom. However, I will not go into
too much detail about the power law here. You can read Thiel's book for a much better and deeper understanding, and that is a book that I would highly recommend.

The focus of today's post is on how we can leverage the power law via tooling. Tooling refers to the tools, workflow, and setups that you use in order to get your work done. In a software engineering context, it means your text editor (or IDE), your mastery of programming languages, your desktop environment or window manager setup, automated task runners, custom commands and hotkeys for your workflow, your computer, workspace configuration, and working environment.
