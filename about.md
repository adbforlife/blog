Hello! I am Zeng Fan Pu from Singapore. My first name is Fan Pu. I currently work as a software engineer at [Saleswhale](https://saleswhale.com). I will be enrolling in Carnegie Mellon University soon this fall. This blog was started on 24 June 2018 and it is built using [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). 

I mainly write about my thoughts about work, code, new things that I recently learned, and anything else that might be of interest to the reader. I hope you enjoy your stay here!
