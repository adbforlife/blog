Hello! I am Fan Pu Zeng from Singapore, and I am currently based in Pittsburgh.
Just to avoid any confusion, my first name is Fan Pu. I am currently
a rising junior studying in [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) under the School of
Computer Science. I used to work as a software engineer at
[Saleswhale](https://saleswhale.com) before I enrolled in college. In the following summer, I interned at [Asana](https://asana.com/) under the Infrastructure Management team. I am currently interning at Facebook on the Tupperware Scheduler Production Engineering team as a Production Engineer intern.

This blog was started on 24 June 2018 and is built using [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

I write mainly about code, school, interesting new things that I recently learned, and anything else that might be of interest to the reader. I hope you enjoy your stay here!
